# NeuraGlance

An AI-powered application that scrapes product reviews from various platforms (Amazon, Flipkart, Google Shopping, and others) and provides sentiment analysis and insights to help users make informed purchasing decisions.

## Features

- Search for products by name or URL
- Dynamic web scraping with multiple fallback methods (Puppeteer, ScraperAPI, and direct requests)
- Sentiment analysis and key points extraction using Google's Gemini API
- Modern, responsive UI with a gradient-based theme
- In-memory caching for performance optimization
- Comprehensive contact form with form validation and feedback messages

## How It Works

### Architecture

The application consists of:

1. **Express Backend (server.js): Handles API requests, web scraping, and AI analysis
2. *Frontend*: Modern HTML/CSS/JS interface with a responsive design
   - index.html: Core structure with multiple pages (Home, Analyze, About, Contact)
   - styles.css: Styling with modern gradients and animations
   - script.js: Client-side functionality and API integration

### Product Analysis Flow

1. *User Input*:
   - Users can search for products by name (e.g., "iPhone 15")
   - Users can also provide a direct product URL from Amazon, Flipkart, or Google

2. *Backend Processing*:
   - The application scrapes reviews from multiple sources
   - Reviews are analyzed using the Gemini API
   - Results are formatted and returned to the frontend

3. *Analysis Display*:
   - Overall sentiment with percentage visualization
   - Key topics mentioned in reviews
   - Sample positive and negative reviews
   - Product pros and cons

### Contact System

The application includes a contact form:
- Form validation ensures all required fields are completed
- Integration with getform.io for form processing
- Real-time feedback messages for form submission status

#### Getform.io Integration

The contact form uses [getform.io](https://getform.io), a form backend platform that collects, stores, and sends form submissions to your email without requiring any backend code. Here's how it works:

1. When a user submits the contact form, the data is sent directly to getform.io
2. Getform processes the submission and stores it in your dashboard
3. You receive an email notification about the new submission
4. You can view and manage all submissions from the getform.io dashboard

#### Setting Up Getform.io

To set up your own getform.io integration:

1. *Create a Getform Account*:
   - Go to [getform.io](https://getform.io) and sign up for an account
   - They offer a free tier with up to 50 submissions per month

2. *Create a Form Endpoint*:
   - From your dashboard, click "Create Form"
   - Give your form a name (e.g., "NeuraGlance Contact Form")
   - Getform will generate a unique form endpoint URL (looks like https://getform.io/f/your-unique-id)

3. *Update the Contact Form*:
   - Open public/index.html
   - Locate the form element in the contact section
   - Replace the action attribute with your getform.io endpoint:
     html
     <form action="https://getform.io/f/your-unique-id" method="POST">
     

4. *Configure Form Options* (Optional):
   - From your getform.io dashboard, you can:
     - Set up email notifications
     - Add spam protection
     - Configure webhook integrations
     - Enable reCAPTCHA
     - Set up autoresponders

5. *Testing Your Form*:
   - Submit a test message through your contact form
   - Check your getform.io dashboard to confirm it was received
   - Verify you received the email notification (if configured)

The implementation in NeuraGlance already includes:
- Honeypot spam protection (hidden field that bots fill out but humans don't)
- Form validation for required fields 
- Success/error feedback messages to inform users about submission status

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, you'll need:

1. *Node.js*: Version 14 or higher
2. *NPM*: For package management
3. *Gemini API Key*: For sentiment analysis (replaces previously used OpenAI)
4. *ScraperAPI Key* (Optional): For more reliable scraping
5. *Chrome/Chromium*: Required for Puppeteer browser automation

## API Setup Guide

### Setting Up Gemini API (Required)

1. *Create a Google Cloud Account*:
   - Go to [Google Cloud](https://cloud.google.com/)
   - Sign up for an account or log in if you already have one

2. *Get Your Gemini API Key*:
   - Navigate to the [API Keys section](https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey)
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy the generated API key

3. *Billing Setup*:
   - Google requires a payment method for API usage beyond free tier
   - Navigate to the Billing section
   - Add a payment method
   - You can set usage limits to control costs

### Setting Up ScraperAPI (Optional but Recommended)

1. *Create a ScraperAPI Account*:
   - Go to [ScraperAPI's website](https://www.scraperapi.com/)
   - Sign up for an account

2. *Choose a Plan*:
   - ScraperAPI offers various plans, including a free tier with 1,000 API calls
   - For testing purposes, the free tier should be sufficient

3. *Get Your API Key*:
   - After signing up, you'll be taken to your dashboard
   - Your API key will be displayed on the dashboard
   - Copy this key for use in the .env file
